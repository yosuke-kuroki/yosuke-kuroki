##  ðŸ˜Š About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Yosuke Kuroki - a senior LLM/ML Engineer / Full Stack developer* working at the intersection of real-world data, scalable backend systems, and modern LLM architectures.

â€¢ Designed and implemented an end-to-end automation pipeline for payment processing using Selenium and RPA tools to reduce manual intervention and ensure reliable deployment in CI/CD workflows.

â€¢ Developed intelligent document parsing scripts integrated with GPT-4o-mini to extract structured information, and leveraged Python for backend processing and cloud-native deployment

â€¢ Built a monitoring dashboard that tracks automation workflows and triggers alerts via cloud logging and monitoring services to improve visibility and system uptime. 

â€¢ Build a cloud-native RPA solution that combines Selenium and Kubernetes to orchestrate scalable and fault-tolerant automation processes.

â€¢ Designed a secure automation system using containerized workflows and integrated CI/CD pipelines to streamline form submission and data validation tasks.

â€¢ Built automated ingestion and preprocessing pipelines using Azure AI and cloud functions, and embedded unstructured documents into a vector database for downstream search.

â€¢ Designed a scalable augmented search generation (RAG) pipeline using a cloud-native vector database and Kubernetes to implement advanced contextual search.

â€¢ Implemented cognitive automation by integrating AI models with RPA bots, improving extraction accuracy and contextual decision-making across document workflows.

â€¢ Developed AI-powered document search systems utilizing Azure Blob Storage, embedding models, and REST APIs to optimize latency and retrieval relevance.

â€¢ Implemented a Graph RAG system with Neo4j on Kubernetes, enhancing relationship mapping for AI-assisted analytics.

â€¢ Integrated BERT-based GCN KIE models within LangChain pipelines to improve document intelligence workflows, leveraging Weights, Biases for experimentation.

â€¢ Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) and summarization techniques in Kubernetes-deployed NLP microservices for intelligent document understanding.

â€¢ Utilized Llama2 models via LangChain for enterprise content generation, integrating outputs with REST-based business systems.

â€¢ Enhanced NLP document processing efficiency using CUDA-accelerated stacks in containerized environments. 

â€¢ Led the development of a CNN-based OCR model optimized for GPU inference, reducing latency by 41% with TensorRT and Docker
